# SpaceJS
Javascript Interpreter for Space Engineers

The plan is to build a javascript engine for space engineers as a replacement for the in-game programmable block C# api.

It will use a port of jint that reimplements all the prohibited type/members and refactors the C# 7 code to work with the older Space Engineers version of C#.
