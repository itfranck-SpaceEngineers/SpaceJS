# SpaceJS
Javascript Programmable Block replacement for Space Engineers.

Work in progress...

## Completed
* Interpreter working
* "Javascript Programmable Block" block created/working.  You can edit the code just like the old PB and click a button to Run it.
* Implement "console.log" (temporarily outputs to chat for testing purposes)

## TODO
* Refactor the jint expression interpreter to support stepping through the program one call at a time for throttling purposes.
* Implement the Space Engineers Ingame MODAPI within javascript.
* Add actions to "Javascript Programmable Block" so that it can be triggered with arguments through button panels, cockpits, etc.
* Create event system.
